WebPage Vulnerability Scanner

This project of ours mainly deals with finding the vulnerabilities that could be found on to while browsing any website. With our project, user can give the url of the website which is to be used and can know if their browsing website has any vulnerability or not. For the same we have used HTML/CSS, JavaScript in the front-end and used Xampp-php as our back-end.


Note:To access the back-end of our project, the user is required to have Xampp-php.
